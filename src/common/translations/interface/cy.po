"Wild pollinators may have declined in the UK by more than 30% since 1980, "
"but we need much more data to be able to track changes in abundance. You can"
" help by doing a FIT Count, maybe even repeating it over the season. You "
"don’t need to identify the insects to species level, only to within broad "
"groups e.g. bumblebees, hoverflies, butterflies & moths, wasps"

"Efallai bod peillwyr gwyllt wedi gostwng yn y Deyrnas Unedig gan dros 30% "

"efallai y gallwch ei wneud nifer o weithiau drwy'r tymor hyd yn oed . Does "
"dim angen i chi allu enwi'r union rywogaethau o bryfed, dim ond eu rhoi mewn"
