"Both the Environment Agency (EA) and the Scottish Environment Protection "
"Agency (SEPA) provide a blue-green algae analytical service and advice to "
"local authorities, water body owners, managers etc. However there is no "
"routine national algal bloom monitoring system, and so records of past bloom"
" events are patchy. By recording blue-green algal blooms through this app, "
"we hope to get a better overall picture of the timing and location of algal "
"blooms across the UK, to help inform local authorities and relevant health "
"agencies of potential public health risks and aid the EA & SEPA in bloom "
"management and prevention in the future."

# About info page content

"The app also asks you for details of what activities you are carrying out in"
" or around the water, as blue-green algal blooms pose a greater risk to "
"water-based activities, such as swimming or windsurfing, compared to non-"
"contact activities such as walking. By gathering details of activities "
"undertaken we hope to gain a better understanding of how algal blooms are "
"impacting recreational use of freshwaters in the UK."

"Blue-green algae naturally occur in lakes, ponds, canals, rivers and "
"reservoirs around the world. However they can produce toxins that are "
"harmful to the health of people and animals. These algae are most commonly "
"seen during the summer months, particularly in calm warm conditions. They "
"are microscopic but clump together in visible colonies up to a few "
"millimetres in size that can rise to the surface and form thin wispy blooms "
"or thick paint-like scums if the numbers are very large."
