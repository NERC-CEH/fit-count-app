"The Flower-Insect Timed Count (FIT Count) is a 10-minute survey designed to "
"collect new data on numbers of flower-visiting insects."
msgstr ""

# About page content
msgid ""
"FIT Counts are suitable for all, in urban or rural locations, and can be "
"done at any time between the beginning of April and end of September."
msgstr ""

# About page content
msgid ""
"Wild pollinators may have declined in the UK by more than 30% since 1980, "
"but we need much more data to be able to track changes in abundance. You can"
" help by doing a FIT Count, maybe even repeating it over the season. You "
"don’t need to identify the insects to species level, only to within broad "
"groups e.g. bumblebees, hoverflies, butterflies & moths, wasps"
msgstr ""

# About page content
msgid ""
"The FIT Count is part of the UK Pollinator Monitoring Scheme (PoMS), within "
"the UK Pollinator Monitoring and Research Partnership which comprises the UK"
" Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH), Bumblebee Conservation Trust, "
"Butterfly Conservation, British Trust for Ornithology, Hymettus, Reading "
"University, University of Leeds and Natural History Museum. PoMS is jointly "
"funded by Defra, the Welsh and Scottish Governments, Daera, JNCC and project"
