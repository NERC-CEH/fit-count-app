msgid "Wild pollinators may have declined in the UK by more than 30% since 1980, but we need much more data to be able to track changes in abundance. You can help by doing a FIT Count, maybe even repeating it over the season. You don’t need to identify the insects to species level, only to within broad groups e.g. bumblebees, hoverflies, butterflies & moths, wasps"
